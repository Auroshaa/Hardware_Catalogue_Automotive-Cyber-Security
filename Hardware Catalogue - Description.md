# Hardware Security Feature Catalogue  

## 📌 Overview  
The Hardware Security Feature Catalogue is a centralized platform designed to help engineers and project teams quickly evaluate and compare security features of various microcontrollers (MCUs). By extracting security requirements directly from datasheets and security manuals, the catalog provides a structured and accessible reference for secure MCU selection.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Google Sheets** → Used as the backend database.  
- **Google Apps Script** → Middleware to connect Sheets with Google Sites.  
- **Google Sites** → Frontend platform to display data and provide interactive comparison tables.  

## 🔑 Features  
- 📄 **Data Collection Template** → Standardized format to extract MCU security features from datasheets/manuals.  
- 📊 **Google Sheets Database** → Acts as a centralized repository of security requirements.  
- 🔗 **Apps Script Middleware** → Automates data flow between Google Sheets and Google Sites.  
- 🌐 **Google Sites Integration** → Interactive platform accessible across the organization.  
- 📈 **Comparison Tables** → Enables quick evaluation of MCUs to select the most suitable option for any project.  

## 🚀 Benefits  
- Centralized repository for MCU security requirements.  
- Faster and more accurate MCU selection process.  
- Standardized documentation across the organization.  
- Improved collaboration and knowledge sharing.
